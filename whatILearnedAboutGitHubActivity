Name: Answer 

1.We've been talking about GitHub and how it relates to R/R Studio. What is your takeaway from today's class?

My biggest takeaway from today's class was hearing you explain the terminology in simple terms.
I feel like I gained a better understanding of push/pull requests and repositories throughout class today.
 
2. What is one question that you still have ?

I definitely still need work with hands on experience within github. I understand the terminology but I get extrmeely confused trying to navigate 
my way around github.
